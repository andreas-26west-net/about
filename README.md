Hello everyone!

This is Andreas, based in Munich, Germany.

I'm doing web-development for ages, since about 1997, if memory serves correctly.
For the most part I followed a strategy of trial-and-error, of creatively playing with html, css and js. Which doesn't mean there were not also substantial results...

For the last couple of years things got substantially more serious: I now work as application developer at ARRI (= Arnold & Richter, a maker of professional camera and lighting equipment), helping to create an extensive production control and documentation tool.
The tool is designed as a web-app, for easy access and distribution. The framework is Angular.

And that's my main interest currently:
- coding Angular,
- practicing Angular,
- learning more Angular,
- turning everything into Angular which isn't Angular yet...
