Hello everyone!

Andreas here, based in Munich, Germany.

I'm doing web-development for ages, since about 1997, if memory serves well.
For the most part of this time it was more a strategy of trial-and-error, of creatively playing with html, css and js. Which doesn't mean there were not also substantial results...

For the last couple of years things got even more serious: I work now as application developer at ARRI (= Arnold & Richter, the maker of professional camera and lighting equipment), helping to create a unique production control tool.
The tool is designed as web-app, for easy and instant distribution. The framework is Angular.

And that's currently my main interest: coding with Angular, practicing Angular, learning more Angular.
